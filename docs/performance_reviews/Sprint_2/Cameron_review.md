| Cameron       | -         | -        |
| Saurav        | - Great leader, good at organizing and efficiently coordinating and delegating        | - Takes charge when guidance is needed, good at programming and lending a hand when needed. Would like if sometimes a bit more instruction was given at times.      |
| Rishi         | - Knowledgeable, Speaks up when wanting to share his thoughts, though inconsistent at times        | - Did not push code on time always, this caused deadlines to be missed and lots of confusion in the group, communication needs work       |
| Gurleen       | - Easy to work with, needs to communicate more        | - Knowledgeable with what she does, although I occasionally find myself wondering what she is doing since she occasionally doesn't talk as much as I would like       |
| Baasil        | - Works hard, reliable. Minor communication issues        | - Very good at everything he does, although there was an instance where he misinterpreted an instruction which caused him to do more work than needed. |
