# Hypothetical changes to be made
*** 
## Task participation

### Proper task assignments
Design task made clear by the team, 
but more cooperation with the team members to
ensure similar design on common elements could 
have been made.
### Proper Kanban board assignments
Best effort was made to properly document stuff
on the kanban board. Still, task descriptions 
and labels could be made clearer.
### Particiation in code reviews
Code reviews consisted of making sure
that the code was functional and the description
of code functionality and dependence, in addition 
to other factors. However, documentation of 
anything other that functionality
is scarce. Hypothetically, documentation could also 
have included potential enhancements,
necessary refactoring, ensuring the maintainance of
existing functionality, discussion about appropriate
unit tests, adherence to coding standards and principles
and a total evaluation of new code that was made
in the team meetings, not just functionality.

The feedback received on the code reviews could have been 
documented as well.

### Documentation of issues
Best effort was undertaken to ensure proper 
documentation of issues and they were thoroughly
discussed in the team meetings. Still, for the benefit
of the team, clearer documentation of the issues
could have been made, including labelling issues
and better descriptions could have been provided.
### Effort in code production
The code works, but hypothetically, strict adherence
to code style guidelines, including proper 
use of docstrings would have been ensured.
Tests could have been made more comprehensive 
and more common design patterns could have been
used more. 

## Process
### Proper use of Kanban board
Task assignments could have been made with a 
uniform format and more regular progress 
updates on the Kanban board could have been made. 
### Regular task progress reports
The documentation of task progress could have been
better, with more descriptive entries in the kanban
board and clear and more specific documentation in 
the meeting notes. 
### Code reviews
Code reviews could have been made more specific, with 
more inclusions of example code.
The backlog items generated from code reviews
could have been documented properly, with a short
description in each code review.
### Performance reviews
Performance reviews could have been conducted more
often, with better documentation.
Much clearer evaluation criterion could have been
established to provide specific and objective feedback
regarding code quality, efficiency, problem solving
skills and teamwork. Follow up reviews conducted
could have been documented as well.
### Submission methodology
Any direct merges into the master branch would be
strongly discouraged. The pull request deadline would
be thoroughly enforced with supporting documentation.
## Product
### File loading with requirements.txt
More reasearch could have been done to explore better
methods to achieve this.
### Complete ReadMe
ReadMe could have directly linked to all items
in the description for better access. 
Clearer description regarding running tests and
required packages could have been provided.
### Complete team architecture design document
The team architecture document could have included
more details on interface design, clearly specfying
the methods, input, outputs and data types and error
handling. Interactions with the overall project
components and architectural details encompassing 
the component's structure, behaviour and characteristics
could be better outlined and dependencies highlighted.
### Unit tests
Unit tests can be added to include all the public
methods in the code. They can also be modified to 
include testing of valid inputs, confirming that they
return the expected output, and also the testing
of invalid inputs, making sure that all possible 
scenarios are properly handled.
### Docstrings
Complete and appropriate docstrings can be provided,
that clearly outline the purpose, inputs and outputs
of modules and public interfaces.
### Stub implementations
All stub implementations can be completed and appropriate
documentation provided.
### Ending status
Ending status of the task at the sprint can be 
documented more clearly, in regards to workablity and 
startup.
### Appropriate coding standards
SOLID principles can be more strictly followed,
ensuring single responsiblity, open/closed principle
Liskov substituition principle, interface segration,
and dependency inversion. More thorough examination
of the code to ensure de-coupling could have been made.
More common patterns could have been used to 
simplify coding, ensuring incompatible interfaces
work better together. 

Naming conventions, documentation standards and 
proper code structure rules could have been more
strictly followed.
### Task completion
The working code could be made simpler, more
complete, follow proper conventions and 
incorporate more ideas generated from code
reviews. The attribution table can be more
expansive and details, highlighting each 
contribution and refer to the source clearer.
