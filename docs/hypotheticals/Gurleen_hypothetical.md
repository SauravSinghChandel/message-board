* Assign a minimum of one interface design task to ensure attention to user experience and interface aesthetics. 
* Assign at least two coding tasks to demonstrate proficiency in programming skills. 
* Set a benchmark of 40 lines of code per task to encourage substantial and meaningful contributions.

### Participation as SCRUM master and note-taker
* Fulfill the responsibilities of the SCRUM master role, including leading the meetings, sprint planning, and retrospectives. 
* Take thorough and accurate meeting notes during team meetings. 
* Distribute meeting minutes promptly to keep the team informed and aligned on goals and action items.

## Process

### Kanban board used to track progress
* Utilize a digital or physical Kanban board to visually represent the progress of tasks throughout the sprint. 
* Clearly distinguish between different stages of tasks (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done) for easy tracking. 
* Regularly update the board to reflect the current status of each task, allowing team members to have a real-time view of progress.

### Regular reports of task progress appear throughout the sprint
* Provide regular, concise updates on the progress of assigned tasks during team meetings. 
* Clearly communicate completed work, work in progress, and any potential blockers or challenges. 
* Include estimates for remaining work and any adjustments to the original plan.

### Code reviews of your submissions by team members is meaningful and leads to new backlog items where appropriate
* Conduct code reviews with a focus on constructive feedback and improvement. 
* Ensure that code reviews result in meaningful discussions and, when necessary, lead to the creation of new backlog items for improvements or bug fixes. 
* Encourage a collaborative environment where team members actively participate in code reviews to share knowledge and enhance overall code quality.

### Performance review conducted by team and student response where needed.
* Conduct regular performance reviews as a team to assess individual and collective progress. 
* Discuss achievements, challenges, and areas for improvement openly and constructively. 
* Provide feedback in a way that encourages growth and development, fostering a positive team culture.
* Acknowledge and respond to performance feedback with a reflective and proactive mindset. 
* Address any identified areas for improvement and provide insights into strategies for personal and team growth.

### Submission must be made as a branch/pull request using team approved methodology.
* Adhere to the team's approved code submission deadlines. 
* Submit work as branches or pull requests, ensuring that each submission follows the established guidelines and naming conventions. 
* Include relevant documentation and test cases along with the submission to facilitate smooth integration and review.

### Met the team imposed sprint pull-request deadline.
* Comply with the team's sprint pull-request deadline to maintain a synchronized and efficient workflow. 
* Plan and manage tasks effectively to meet the submission deadlines and avoid disruptions to the overall sprint timeline. 
* Communicate proactively if challenges arise that may impact the ability to meet the deadline, and work collaboratively to find solutions.

## Product

### Repository team README file includes where to find my design components and code, how to run your unit tests, and how to exercise your code within the current main/master branch project codebase.
* Design Components and Code Location: Clearly specify where design components and code are located within the repository. Provide directory paths or links to relevant folders for easy navigation.
* Running Unit Tests: Include instructions on how to run unit tests for the design components. Clearly outline the steps or commands needed to execute the tests successfully.
* Exercising Code within the Project Codebase: Explain how to integrate and exercise the developed code within the current main/master branch of the project. Include any dependencies or configurations required for seamless integration.
* Additional Documentation Indication: Clearly indicate in the README file if there are other documentation files relevant to individual assessment. Provide links or references to additional documentation that markers should consider.

### Team architecture design document indicates how your interface design and code fits into the overall project components.
* Integration with Overall Project: Clearly articulate how the interface design and code of your component fit into the overall project components. Describe the relationships and dependencies between your component and other project elements.
* UML and Architecture Document: Include UML diagrams that detail the architectural aspects of your component's interface. Provide a comprehensive architecture document that describes the purpose, structure, and interactions of your component within the larger system.

### Unit tests are correct and working (not necessarily passing) for public interface methods/services of your design components and coding tasks, sufficient to test a correct mode and incorrect mode for different method invocations.
* Ensure that unit tests are correct, addressing both correct and incorrect modes of method invocations.
* Tests should be designed to verify the expected behavior of public interface methods/services.

### Docstrings are complete and appropriate for all modules and public interface elements of your design components and coding tasks
* Write complete and appropriate docstrings for all modules and public interface elements of design components.
* Docstrings should effectively communicate the purpose, parameters, and return values of functions and classes.

### Stub implementations were/are completed where needed to support prototyping of your public interface methods.
* Clearly indicate where stub implementations have been used to support prototyping.
* Explain the rationale behind the use of stubs and how they contribute to the development process.

### Status of tasks at end of sprint is clearly documented
* Document the status of each task at the end of the sprint.
* Clearly specify whether tasks are completed, in progress, or deferred for future sprints.

### Code component shows consideration of SOLID, de-coupling, common patterns (Adapter) and other code style and standards applied as appropriate.
* Demonstrate consideration of SOLID principles in the codebase.
* Showcase decoupling strategies and the use of common design patterns (e.g., Adapter) where appropriate. 
* Explain how these choices contribute to the maintainability and flexibility of the code.

### Task completion with finished working code and attributions table
* Provide an attributions table documenting contributions from team members.
* Clearly list who worked on each task and the corresponding code.
