-> 5/10 points Code production and time spent shows a serious effort undertaken
    - I am not sure what more I could've done in this specific section. I was assigned Session Management which I already finished in Sprint 1.
    I was assigned other tasks which other members did not submit on the deadline so I finished all of the other functionality which included working
    on the database, server, HTML Templates and app logic.

-> 3/5 points Task completion with finished working code and attributions table
    - Same as above

-> 3/5 points Code component shows consideration of SOLID, de-coupling, common patterns (Adapter) and other code style and standards applied as appropriate.
    - Improvements in  coding style wouldve been made after further consulations about expectations

-> 4/5 points Regular reports of task progress appear throughout the sprint
    - Regular Commits were made and issues were created after the feedback of Sprint 1 was returned 

-> 3/5 points Code reviews of your submissions by team members is meaningful and leads to new backlog items where appropriate
    - Most of the code reviews were done on my pull requests because fixing the code so I couldnt participate in code reivews as much. Wouldve participated more in the code reviews more

-> 2/5 points Performance review conducted by team and student response where needed.
    - Performance reviews were everything I felt was appropriate and were accurate up to the users performance.

-> 3/5 points Submission must be made as a branch/pull request using team approved methodology.
See commits merged directly with master without PR.
    - All of the commits made directly to the master branch were deleting unwanted files from the branch which were pushed accidentally or in the wrong directory

-> 3/8 points Team architecture design document indicates how your interface design and code fits into the overall project components.
Architectural details of your component interface are detailed in UML and described in architecture document.
    - I am not sure what exactly I could've improved in this, but improvements wouldve been made after consulting professor/TA.

-> 5/10 points Unit tests are correct and working (not necessarily passing) for public interface methods/services of your design components and coding tasks, sufficient to test a correct mode and incorrect mode for different method invocations.
    - More unit tests wouldve been added to the codebase

-> 5/10 points Docstrings are complete and appropriate for all modules and public interface elements of your design components and coding tasks
    - More appropriate and detailed docstrings wouldve been added to the codebase
