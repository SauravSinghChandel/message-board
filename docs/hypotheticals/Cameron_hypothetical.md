Effort and Participation (28%)

2/2 points Task assignments are clear from team minutes
3/3 points Tasks are assigned in cards on kanban board
3/5 points Participation in code review presentations to team ensure team understands interface and code and receive feedback

 
 - I don't know of any code review presentations I was not a part of

5/5 points Issues and difficulties completing tasks are reported through team meetings and kanban
5/10 points Code production and time spent shows a serious effort undertaken

 
 - Many hours for communication and code production were taken each week, unclear what the criteria for 'having a serious effort' would be.

3/3 points Participation as SCRUM master and note-taker
Process (25%)

5/5 points Kanban board used to track progress
4/5 points Regular reports of task progress appear throughout the sprint
3/5 points Code reviews of your submissions by team members is meaningful and leads to new backlog items where appropriate

 
 - Most of the time the only issues with code in code reviews was left over comments or a lack of docstrings. Unsure what else I could have added, I would have asked for more guidance on what to look for.

2/5 points Performance review conducted by team and student response where needed.

 
 - I am not sure what else I could have added to my performance reviews, I gave constructive criticism when needed and gave my feedback. Would have asked for more guidance on how the performance reviews should have been written.

3/5 points Submission must be made as a branch/pull request using team approved methodology.
See commits merged directly with master without PR.

 
 - Only commits merged to master without PR were removing accidental code / unwanted temporary files etc.

You must meet the team imposed sprint pull-request deadline.

 
 - Team imposed sprint PR deadlines were followed to the best of my knowledge, occasionally the deadline was pushed back due to circumstances beyond our control.

Product (47%)

2/2 points Repository team README file includes where to find your design components and code, how to run your unit tests, and how to exercise your code within the current main/master branch project codebase.
Other documentation you want the marker to consider for individual assessment must be indicated in the project README file
3/8 points Team architecture design document indicates how your interface design and code fits into the overall project components.
Architectural details of your component interface are detailed in UML and described in architecture document.

 
 - If we were given this feedback sooner, I would've likely wanted to discuss how to better implement the arcitecture documents and how to go about fixing / improving my documents from last sprint.

5/10 points Unit tests are correct and working (not necessarily passing) for public interface methods/services of your design components and coding tasks, sufficient to test a correct mode and incorrect mode for different method invocations.



5/10 points Docstrings are complete and appropriate for all modules and public interface elements of your design components and coding tasks

 
 - I would have focused more on docstrings, and more complete / thorough documentation

2/2 points Stub implementations were/are completed where needed to support prototyping of your public interface methods.
5/5 points Status of tasks at end of sprint is clearly documented
3/5 points Code component shows consideration of SOLID, de-coupling, common patterns (Adapter) and other code style and standards applied as appropriate.

 
 - With this feedback I would have ensured to put more emphasis on these coding styles and found ways to implement them better into our project.

3/5 points Task completion with finished working code and attributions table
