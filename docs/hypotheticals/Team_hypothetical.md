-> 3/5 points includes progress on agenda items suggested by prof on class diary/webpage
    - Wouldve made more detialed agenda and included more details in meeting notes

-> 2/5 points changes to architecture and low level designs (interfaces) discussed, determined, and documented. Architecture document in docs folder
    - We woudlve been more consistent about meeting notes for sprint 3 by objectively including speicifc tasks assigned to each individual members

-> 2/4 points Problems with the team progress, dynamics and process must be identified and documented, and tracked with possible responses and progress on those items becoming kanban/agenda items.
    - These improvements were made but after sprint 1 so they did not show up in the sprint 2 until late. More improvements wouldve been corresponding to specific feeback and further consulation

-> 5/10 points Code reviews are thorough, covering style issues (SOLID, de-coupling) as well as correctness.
Do you mention solid, dry or regression testing anywhere?
    - We were not clear if were expected that in code reviews and exactly how to implement that in our process. Improvements wouldve been made after consultation about specific expectations regarding format and content

-> 0/2 points Pull request deadlines established and enforced.
    - Deadlines were setup but due to some mis communication they were not added to the meeting notes, this wouldve been fixed for sprint 3.
    - Some of the deadlines were not met by some team memebers so the task were assigned wihtout deadlines to other members due to workload from other courses adding upto this factor

-> 3/5 points Details of components and interfaces in document
SOME of the components have interface details.
    - Specific imporvements would've been made after consulting more about exact expectations

-> 2/5 points Use of diagramming and prose to concisely offer complete details
A prose description of a module is not sufficient without the interface specified; why not diagram the interface as I showed in the video?
    - The website and videos were regularly getting not accessible and some weeks were missed due to that. We woudl've improved this if this feedback was received earlier
The component diagrams were OK, but not consistent across the team.
    - We used planttext to generate the diagrams, but when generating individual components, it was inconsistent. Reason for that is unknown

-> 2/5 points Consistent with modules, interfaces, docstring and unit tests
Seem to be, but you have to specify the interfaces for me to grade this.
    - We woudlve linked those specific requirements in the readme in a specific section for better accessibility

-> 1/5 points Elements of process identified and explained. Distinction made between process and process model.
no diagram, process model components or comparison to standard sprint.
1/5 points Changes in process since beginning of project are discussed.
Are these changes? Or what you always did? Are the part of the model?
0/5 points Ideas for improving process in future and what will team do about it.

    - This specific section was not clear to us. We decided to improve this after feedback because we couldnt find what were exactly expected for this part and how to incorporate that in our project
